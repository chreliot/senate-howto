## Why be interested in this?

We joined the university, pretty much all of us, to work on things other than academic policy. But we all want to do well here, and we want the university to do well. Having a set of guidelines and rules governing how we do things can help everyone do what they want to do here well. Ideally, those guidelines—those *policies*—set us up to teach and learn and engage with one another happily and productively, without onerous encumbrances. Moreover, ideally the policies are ones we can get behind, because we or our elected representatives had a hand in crafting them or in keeping them around.

## Why is there a University Senate?

Accordingly, Hofstra's Faculty Statute VII establishes “a University Senate, convened by the Faculty.” Our senate has “general powers of supervision over all academic matters concerning the University as a whole.” And it can take up “any other matters referred to it by the Board of Trustees, the University President, or the Provost of the University” (FS VII).

## What are the Senate's areas of responsibility?

Besides supervising "all academic matters concerning the University as a whole" and dealing with matters referred to it, the Senate is empowered to “review and provide recommendations on policies and initiatives impacting academic matters.” And, besides, it can “generate initiatives regarding academic matters” (FS VII 3). So, it supervises, reviews, and initiates. And it does those things with  both academic matters and anything impacting academic matters. The result can be policies, but also reports and other initiatives. 

## Which policies does the Senate work on?

The main institutional, academic and academic-related policies the Senate works on are in three places:

 * **[The Faculty Policy Series][FPS]**: The FPS sets out policies and procedures for faculty members. There are currently about 62 of them, numbered between 1 and 99. More workaday than the Statutes—less fundamental and structural and more procedural—they range widely in topic, from instructional matters like handling academic integrity violations and grade appeals; to research matters like conflict of interest, copyright, and misconduct policies; to organizational matters like the responsibilities of department chairs and how adjunct faculty are hired; to employment matters like research leave and sick leave.
 * **[The Bulletins][Bulletin]**: Published annually, the Bulletins come in several forms: Undergraduate, Graduate, and Law and for undergraduate main/Summer/January sessions. They are fully online. Besides course and program descriptions, each bulletin outlines academic policies in a student-oriented way. It tells students what they can expect from the university and what will be required of them.
 * **[The Faculty Statutes][FS]**: These nine items (plus two more moved or withdrawn), numbered with Roman I to XI, represent general, foundational policies. They establish the university's administrative structure, determine who is on the Faculty and how they're appointed to it, specify how faculty meetings shall be conducted, and create the senate itself. 
 
Much of the work of the Senate involves supervising the FPS and the general, university-wide portions of the Bulletin. The FPS is the main place the Senate commits new and updated procedures.

Most of the Senate's business concerns policies for the schools *other than* the Zucker School of Medicine and the Deane School of Law. The medical school and the law school each have a representative on the Senate, and their faculty serve in committee roles—especially on Faculty Affairs and Planning & Budget, where business can affect them—but those schools enjoy autonomy for their academic policies. 

Occasionally, the Senate also passes items that don't fit neatly into the FPS or Bulletin, or even the Statutes, like a communication to the University President or guidance to its Registrar.

## What about university policies other than FPS/Bulletin/FS?

An area Hofstra's Senate is *not* involved in is determining faculty, staff, or student workplace conditions and compensation. Those are the domain of Hofstra's collective bargaining units and unions. For faculty, Hofstra's chapter of the American Association of University Professors negotiates agreements that are codified in the current [Collective Bargaining Agreement][CBA], available on the AAUP chapter website.

In practice, this distinction between the appropriate domain of the Senate and the appropriate domain of collective bargaining can be blurry because there are Faculty Policy Series documents on topics like “Work Above Base Load” and “Outside Employment for Faculty.” However, AAUP and administration have negotiated that if there are any conflicts between the FPS and the CBA, the CBA “will control” ([CBA][CBA] 3.2). So, for better or worse, the CBA always has precedence.

Note also that, separately, Hofstra University's Office of Community Standards (within the larger, administrative Division of Student Enrollment, Engagement, and Success) produces the [*Guide to Pride*][GTP] for students. It focuses on non-academic community standards but but also pulls in academic policies from the FPS.

Hofstra also has a variety of other, non-academic policies like those listed [here][policy categories], including safety and security plans, record-retention policy, and the like. Many of these are beyond domain of the Senate, though in certain cases where they impinge on academics, it could be appropriate for the Senate to weigh in on them. Also, for example, the Senate By-laws make the Chemical Hygiene Plan the responsibility of the Special Committee on Environmental Health and Safety.

## What is the Senate's main workflow?

The Senate's work is nearly all done by its committees and therefore by the voting members of the committees. The committees review policies and keep an eye out for issues. They draft policy to send to put before the Senate.

Coordinating between the Senate's committees and the Senate itself is the Executive Committee (SEC). The SEC refers items to committees, and committees send items to the SEC that they hope will come before the Senate. (The members of the SEC are the chairs of the Senate's standing committees and the Provost, with the President of the University Senate chairing, so the SEC normally communicates with standing committees through their chairs.)

At Senate meetings, the Chair of the SEC (who also serves as the Senate President) presents items the SEC has passed to the Senate for approval (see FS VII A.5).

When items are passed by the Senate, they normally go to the full faculty as either information items or action items. 

## What happens to items passed by the Senate?

Action items passed by the Senate normally go to the full faculty for its approval at one if its four annual working meetings (see FS IX). 

Items passed by the full faculty are then sent, via intermediate review by the Provost and the Office of General Counsel, to the University President and Board of Trustees. Items passed by the Senate only become policies when approved and signed by the University President.

The standard approval sequence for Senate proposals is therefore: (subcommittee → ) standing/special committee → Senate Executive Committee → University Senate → Faculty → legal → Provost → University President ( → Board of Trustees).

However, the flow of passed motions is not always linear; items are sometimes  returned to previous stages, including all the way back to the originating committees.

The University President and the Speaker of the Faculty normally notify the Senate and full faculty when they receive notice that the University President has signed something passed by the Senate and Full Faculty.

## Must all Senate items come from its committees?

Though it is not the standard workflow for fully reviewing initiatives, sometimes items are introduced at  Senate or full faculty meetings as motions (subject to guidelines in FS VII, FS X, and *Robert's Rules*). In other words, it's not *required* that items coming before the Senate have their origin in a committee. But because the Senate isn't equipped to evaluate the full implications or complexities of many proposals, new business introduced at Senate may often be referred to the appropriate committee for analysis, or at least to the Executive Committee. 

But also, the Senate's rules specify that “before a vote may be taken on an item presented for action, senators must have had at least two working days published notice” (FS VII C.2.a). So, action items must be circulated in advance. The Senate's Senior Support Specialist usually finalizes and circulates the Senate's agenda on the Thursday before Monday Senate meetings. So, items that need “published notice” need to go to her before then. Ideally, they would also go  to the Senate Executive Committee, which sets the meeting agenda; it normally meets one week before Senate meetings.

## What rules govern the Senate?

The University Senate is established and primarily governed by [Faculty Statute VII, “The University Senate”][FS]. A current copy of the Statutes including this one is available on the [Senate website][Sen]. 

The Senate's [By-laws][bylaws] (thus titled) mostly concern its individual committees, though Section I ("General") lists a handful of broader rules. 

Faculty Statute VII also stipulates that except in matters covered by the Statute, the current edition of *Robert's Rules of Order* shall be considered binding. In practice, the Senate relaxes some requirements like that speakers must stand up, but the meeting structure and proceedings generally conform to the *Rules*.

Of course, in the background, Hofstra's general policies, including those in the [Faculty Policy Series][FPS] related to community standards and professional conduct, continue to apply, as do laws.  

## What rules govern Senate committees?

Senate committees are governed by the same rules as the Senate, but in particular by the sections of the [Senate By-laws][bylaws] establishing their committee. The By-laws set out the membership and the mandate for each committee and sometimes other guidance. Reading one's committee's brief By-laws carefully helps a lot when the question arises, What are we doing here again?

Similarly, Senate committees are governed by *Robert's Rules of Order*. Some awkwardness in committee meetings and grumbling about rules can be due to confusions about what *Robert's Rules* involves. It is widely overlooked that the *Rules* acknowledges that in committees “some of the formality that is necessary in a large assembly would hinder business” (*RRO* 49:21).

Specifically, in committee meetings, *Robert's Rules* indicates: “motions need not be seconded”; “informal discussion of a subject is permitted while no motion is pending”; “when a proposal is perfectly clear to all present, a vote can be taken without a motion’s having been introduced”; generally, “a vote can be taken initially by a show of hands”; and the chair “may, without leaving the chair, speak in informal discussions and in debate, and vote on all questions” (*RRO* 49:21). That is, the *formal* guidelines for committees are pretty casual. Confidently eschew excess formality.

Note that Hofstra Library has available ebooks of both [*Robert's Rules of Order: Newly Revised*][RRONR] and the very helpful, official summary/overview version [*Robert's Rules of Order: Newly Revised in Brief*][RROIB]. (Also note that Hofstra Professor of Mathematics Daniel Seabold is a co-author of both!) A little familiarity with procedure can help one make things happen—not only for committee chairs but also for participants.



## Who is in the Senate?

There are two categories of voting members of the Senate: elected and ex-officio members.

Various constituencies get to elect senators to represent them on the Senate: regular professors from each of the schools and then also adjunct faculty as a unit. Some of these elections are managed by the Senate through its Communications, Outreach, and Election Committee. (See FS VII B.2.)

Other people have a role in the Senate because of their roles elsewhere. Certain administrators, the Speaker and Vice Speaker of the Faculty, the Chair of the Chairs' Caucus, and the student who is President of the Student Government Association are, by virtue of serving in their roles, full voting members of the Senate. These are the ex-officio members. (See FS VII B.1.)

## What are senators-at-large?

The Senate appoints to Senate committees others who are *not* voting members of the Senate. These appointed participants are called “senators-at-large” (styled thus in the Statute), and they can be faculty, administration, chairpersons, or staff. Senators-at-large  serve for two year terms, with renewal possibilities. The purpose of having this role is that the Senate have well-populated committees that are capable of doing the main work of the Senate without making the Senate itself, as a deliberative body, huge and unwieldy. Senators-at-large may participate in the deliberations of the Senate, even though they only vote in committee. (See FS VII B.3.) They play a crucial role in the productivity of the Senate's committees.

## Who is on Senate committees, and in what capacities?

The membership of each Senate committee is specified by its page in the [Senate By-laws][bylaws], and the current members of each committee are listed on the Senate website, on the [committees page][comp].

It is important to recognize, as a committee participant, that not everyone who attends committee meetings attends in the same capacity or has the same responsibilities there. Committees include elected senators and appointed senators-at-large, and they are responsible for doing the work of the committee. The senators and senators-at-large also elect one of their members to be committee's chair. The committee sections of the By-laws also specify an advisor for many of the committees who is usually a member of the Provost's office. And many committees have regular guests who also attend in an advisory capacity, people like the Registrar or the Dean of Graduate Admissions.

## What do committee chairs do?

Each committee's chair is responsible for working with the Senate's Senior Support Specialist to schedule the committee's meetings — ideally at a time when as many members as possible can attend. The chair sets and circulates the agenda for each meeting, keep records on each meeting in the form of minutes, and generally coordinates the work of the committee.

Each chair of a standing committee of the Senate (UAAC, GAAC, FAC, P&B, and SAC) also automatically becomes a member of the Senate Executive Committee (SEC), which coordinates the Senate's work. Besides these chairs, the SEC includes the Senate President, who chairs it, and the Provost (or their designate).

As the SEC normally meets once a month during the academic year, the standing committee chairs regularly report on their committee's work to the SEC.

The chairs of Senate subcommittees (ARC, CoL, CEP, CERT) normally report on behalf of their committees to the parent committees at least once each semester. When it's useful, they may coordinate with the Senate President about reporting to the full Senate.

The chairs of Senate special committees (COEC, SCAP, SCAC, SCEHS) Special Committees normally report in writing to the Senate
Executive Committee once a semester and may be asked by the Senate Executive
Committee to report on specific items directly to the Senate. (SCG normally works with the chair of FAC.)

## When does the Senate meet?

The Senate normally meets once a month during the academic year, typically on Monday afternoons at 1 PM. The Senate may also have special meetings, though that hasn't happened in recent memory. (See FS VII C.2.) The current year's meeting schedule is available through the [Senate website][Sen]. Invitees will receive Outlook calendar invitations well in advance, by email, from the Senate's Senior Support Specialist Caroline Schreiner. 

## Who may attend Senate meetings?

Elected, ex officio senators, and senators-at-large are invited to attend. Members of the faculty, administration, chairpersons, students, and staff may
also observe meetings of the Senate. These others may, upon invitation of the Senate President, and with the consent of the body, participate in its deliberations, but they may not vote. (See FS VII C.2.d.) The Senate has a quorum only when at least half its *elected* members are present (FS VII C.2.c).

## Who coordinates the Senate?

Most of the logistical work required to operate the Senate is performed by the Senate's Senior Support Specialist. She sends the invitations, organizes the agendas, puts out the name placards, coordinates the Zoom during meetings, and lots else. Currently the Senate's Senior Support Specialist is Caroline Schreiner ([contact information][caroline]).

The President of the University Senate runs it. The Senate president is a faculty member who is an elected senator subsequently elected by the Senate to be its president (FS VII C.1.a). The President of the Senate also chairs the Senate's Executive Committee. Until 2023, the University Provost presided over the Senate, while the SEC was chaired by a faculty member. Currently the Senate President is Christopher (Chris) Eliot ([contact information][chris]).

## How can elected senators communicate with their constituents?

The Senate operates “course” sites on Hofstra's Canvas learning management system for each of the faculty units that elect senators. These sites aim to  facilitate democratic engagement with the Senate and raise awareness of Senate initiatives. Ideally, senators will share key items of Senate business and news with constituents. Ideally constituents will be reminded of who their senators are and think of senators as potential recipients for items of concern and promising ideas.

Senators are made “teachers” in of these Canvas courses, and all the faculty in the unit are invited to the “student” role. This allows senators to send announcements to their constituents by email. They can open these announcements for constituent comments, and constituents can reply by email.

The membership of these sites should be refreshed every year. Participants must opt in on Canvas  to participate, and they must also have “receive announcements as emails” turned on in their Canvas settings to receive emails.

For non-faculty student, staff, and administrative senators, communication channels vary by group. (Senators should coordinate with the Senate President and Senior Support Specialist if they need help.) 

## What is “shared governance”?

We sometimes refer to the ecosystem of activities, bodies, and procedures around the University Senate as Hofstra's “shared governance” apparatus. The term derives from principles developed in the 1960s concerning the governance of academic institutions. 

[A statement of core principles][shared] was written and adopted in 1966 the American Association of University Professors (the national organization, not Hofstra's union), the American Council on Education, and the Association of Governing Boards of Universities and Colleges. The statement sets out the areas of responsibility of interdependent parts of the university, including the Board, Faculty, President, et al., highlighting the importance of communication among parties. The statement mentions the idea of “a faculty-elected senate or council for larger divisions or the institution as a whole” as part of laying out ideals for faculty participation in institutional governance, in communication and collaboration with other parties. 

Hofstra's senate is faculty-convened (FS VII A.1), and faculty members structurally have a majority. But ours is not a “faculty senate,” in that administrators, students, and staff also participate and vote. 

One might think of Hofstra's shared governance apparatus as including at least the Senate and its committees, full faculty meetings, the process of transmitting resolutions between the faculty and the University President and Board of Trustees, and consultation between the Faculty Leadership Group and the University President and Provost.

## What is the Faculty Leadership Group?

In 2013 a [resolution][infomtg] was passed specifying that “the [University] President shall meet regularly (preferably at the beginning and the end of the fall and spring semesters,) with the Speaker of the Faculty, the Chair of the Senate Executive Committee, the Chair of the Chairs’ Caucus and when appropriate, other shared governance leadership, to provide informational updates on developments concerning University strategies and policies.”

Then in 2020 that small group of elected faculty leaders plus the AAUP chapter president began meeting regularly with the Provost to address the COVID crisis situation, and they have continued to meet. This “FLG” also meets with the Provost at least twice each semester to discuss concerns, issues, ideas, and the like. Sometimes issues raised in this forum get referred to Senate committees, just as others are referred to appropriate administrators.
